## Legacy Code Projects

* Choosing Legacy Code Projects (what do we look for?)
* Tech Stack (current, how it has evolved, why)
* Application Lifecycle
  * Development, QA, Production
* How do we set it up? (demo-spring-react-example)
  * Staff setup before handoff to students
  * Branch protection rules
* How do we migrate from one quarter to another?
* How do we come up with issues and epics?
* How do we make use of starter stories?
* How do we introduce legacy code projects to the students?
* What do we look for in pull requests for the legacy code projects?
  * Two reviews, one from another team member, one from staff
  * Detailed description with linked issue
* Grading, Point System
  * Get to 100, points are 5, 10, or 20, depending on complexity of work
* Common Pitfalls for students when approaching Legacy Code
  * Smaller, incremental PRs instead of one giant PR
  * Doing the wrong thing well - predictable outcomes
    * Students often write very good code but have a flawed understanding of what the issue at hand is actually for, so they write code that has to be thrown away

## Key Assignments

* jpa00
  * Its purpose: getting started, ensuring students have working setups
* jpa01
  * Its purpose: introduction to Java, unit testing, mutation testing

* jpa02 (first Heroku assignment)
  * Its purpose: introduce Heroku, get students to sign up and learn to deploy apps
  * Very small code changes
  * Discuss the autograder, how to autograde Heroku deployments
* jpa03 (setting up OAuth)
  * Its purpose: introduce the concept of OAuth, secret key values, GitHub Actions
  * How to grade this assignment (manual, rubric, things to watch for)
* team01
  * Its purpose: get students working on backend, creating REST APIs and working with external ones, introducing core git and GitHub concepts such as branching, kanban, pull requests
  * Grading: the autograder(s)
* team02
* team03
* Take-Home Final
  * What goes on it? Interview-type questions that demonstrate learning from this course

## Key In-Class Activities
